# zenkit-compose-harness

This test harness will start up an environment defined in
a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)-like YAML file, and
provides utilities for obtaining information (such as addresses) from that
environment.

See the [examples](./examples) directory for a working example.
